# Assignment Name: Repetition Assignment
# Question Number: 2
# 
# TODO: Jonathan Joestar and Joseph Joestar get into a heated argument and decide
# to spar it out. Jonathan Joestar can take a hit like a champ, as he has 800 
# hit points, while Joseph only has 200 hit points. What Joseph lacks in tankiness
# he makes up for in damage. Joseph can deal damage consistently between 75 to 125.
# This means that Joseph can reduce Jonathanâ€™s hitpoints randomly between 75 to 125.
# Jonathan can only deal between 10 to 40 damage. Create a looped game where they
# fight until one gets knocked out. In each round, each player only gets to attack 
# once, but the first one to land the punch is random. Both players cannot be
# knocked out at the end of the round. Output the health of each character at the 
# end of each round and how much damage their attack does.
