# Assignment Name: Repetition Assignment
# Question Number: 5
# 
# TODO: Create a program that takes a password string 
# from the user and encrypts the letters to go up or down 
# the alphabet using a triple-number key. The amount up or
# down for the encryption of the alphabetical characters 
# will depend on the input from the user. Input for the 
# encryption key integers will be -25 â‰¤ key â‰¤ 25.
